- Get rid of getTag()
  - it's only used by the default serializer when generating a class schema

  - the Tag concept doesn't apply to other serialization schemes
    - they may have their own form of type information instead

  - it would be pefrectly possible to make its existence toggleable with a macro
    BUT it would be ugly as fuck

  - a cleaner alternative, such as serializeTypeInformation could work

- implement class deserialization
- consider possible ways of [de]serializing dynamically allocated class members
- implement JSON RPC
